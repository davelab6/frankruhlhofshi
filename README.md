## About Frank-Rühl

The most common Hebrew typeface in print. It was designed in 1908 by Rafael Frank in collaboration with Auto Rühl of the C. F. Rühl foundry. A final version was released in 1910. Most Israeli books, newspapers and magazines use Frank-Rühl as their body text typeface.
Designed to accommodate the growing need for typefaces in secular Hebrew writings. It was designed to fit modern printing equipment and to be readable in long form texts, with and without diacritical marks.
Its design is based on the Hebrew Sephardi script; on an Italian typeface by 17th punchcutter Daniel Bomberg and on the style of Art Nouveau.
